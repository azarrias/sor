## About
This is not a game nor a remake, this is a humble tribute to the legendary arcade game Streets of Rage, which first came out in the early 90s for Mega Drive console and was ported to many other platforms afterwards.

This tribute has been made as an academic exercise for a Master's Degree in Videogame Development and Design.

## Description
This demo has been developed in C/C++ with SDL 2.0 and although it misses many important bits and pieces from the original game, it has been a very rewarding experience from a learning perspective.

It features one level where some NPCs are spawned at certain locations.

You incarnate Blaze Fielding, one of the player characters from the original game trilogy.

In order to beat the level, you must defeat all the NPCs that are spawned on it.
